> Given variables that describe an individual (gender, marital status, education, monthly household income, and age) and their country of residence, can we predict their support for the courts, national government, civil service, and the military?
>

## File Descriptions:

- `wave1-questions.txt` contains a birds-eye-view of the survey questions. Afterwards, the codebook can be consulted for
  descriptions of the answers.
- `variables.csv` was downloaded from the GitHub documentation link for additional information on important variables.
- `playground.py` includes some starter code

## Approach:

- Decision Trees and Random Forests will be used for interpretability.
